    # Tech Global — Demo static site

This archive contains a BBC-style tech news static website ready for GitHub Pages or other static hosts.

**What's included**

- `index.html` — homepage with hero and cards
- `assets/css/styles.css` — styles (BBC-inspired minimal)
- `assets/images/` — logo.svg and placeholder SVGs (replace with your own photos)
- `articles/` — sample article pages
- `.nojekyll` — prevents GitHub Pages from ignoring files starting with `_`
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` — sample GitHub Actions workflow to deploy to GitHub Pages

**Usage**

1. Unzip and inspect files.
2. Replace placeholder images in `assets/images/` with your own images.
3. Push to a GitHub repository and enable GitHub Pages (or use the included workflow).

> Note: This is a demo package. Replace all placeholder content before publishing.
